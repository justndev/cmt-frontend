### Endpoints
- /api/auth/register - Create user providing nickname and password, returns 200 or 400
- /api/auth/login - Login user, returns jwt token
---
### Tests
Test suit runs with python3 test.py command and will conduct 4 tests regarding the authorization and 5 tests for CMT functionality.
To run:
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 test.py
```
---
### GitHub workflow
There is a script which will run tests and updates the server backend app, which will be triggered on commit and requires IP and secret key.
## Local launch
### Frontend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/justndev/cmt-frontend.git
